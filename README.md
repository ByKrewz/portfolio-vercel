## Deployment

To install and launch the project, follow the instructions below :

1- Clone or download the repo : <br>
 <a href="https://github.com/tom-tamen/portfolio-vercel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download zip</a><br>
 Or<br>
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/tom-tamen/portfolio-vercel.git
 ```
2- Go to the directory<br>
 Unzip and open `portfolio-vercel`<br>
 Or<br>
 ```
 cd portfolio-vercel
 ```
3- Now you have to launch the project with a server to make Three.js work. You can do this with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> extension of <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.

<hr>

For the deployment, I used <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which is very easy to use by following the instructions after linking a Github account. After the deployment, I added <a href="https://www.checklyhq.com/">Checkly</a> in Vercel. This allows you to keep an eye on the performance of your website.

I set up two apps on the repo via <a href="https://github.com/marketplace"> Github marketplace </a>. The first one is <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/imgbot">imgbot</a> which allows to optimize images for your site and the second one is <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/codefactor">CodeFactor</a> which allows to check that our code is compliant and usable.
